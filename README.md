/**
 * This is a simulation to prove the Monty Hall Problem, and to show other
 * alternatives to the problem, say, if there were even more cars, goats, and/or 
 * doors: The Monty Hall Problem is as follows: 
 * 
 * "Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: 
 * Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, 
 * and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, 
 * which has a goat. He then says to you, 'Do you want to pick door No. 2?' Is it 
 * to your advantage to switch your choice?"
 * 
 * By switching, in this scenario, the contestant has a 66% chance of winning, as 
 * opposed to the widely believed 50%.
